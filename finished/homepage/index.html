        I really enjoy math problems of all levels, and I made this animation
        of the 100 Doors problem. Getting the time delay between each door to
        work was difficult but I figured it out in the end.

        I built this as one of the projects on
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. It was my first
        look into Javascript as a language. I've done some work in Python
        before so I really only had to learn the syntax.

        That's this page right here! It will be updated once I set up GitHub
        and maybe start a blog. I'll also take a look at it once I learn more
        and maybe make minor tweaks. But it's my first site and it works,
        that's the important part.
