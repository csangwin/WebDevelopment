      <h2>Here's a brief glimpse into Euler's life and contributions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Leonhard Euler held many titles but was primarily a mathematician.
          Euler made important discoveries in several fields of mathematics, as
          well as creating the terminology and notation we use today.
        </li>
        <li>
          Euler worked in most areas of mathematics, such as algebra, geometry,
          infinitesimal calculus, number theory, and trigonometry. He also
          worked on continuum physics and lunar theory as part of the physics
          branch.
        </li>
        <li>
          Euler has two numbers named after him and is the only mathemtician to
          have achieved this. Euler's number, <em>e</em>, and the
          Euler-Mascheroni constant, <em>&#947</em>.
