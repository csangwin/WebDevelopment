        <p>
          I recently started learning about Web Development and am building
          this site to keep track of some of my work. I have been teaching
          myself with help from several online resources and aim to have a
          couple of sites up and running by the end of the year.

          Below is a selection of some of the first sites I created as a way
          to learn the basic of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'll be adding in
          bigger sites once I've started them.
